# Humbl Engine Skill: Content Planning

## Content Pillar Strategy

David should own 3-5 core topics. All content maps to one of these pillars. This builds Topic Authority on LinkedIn and SEO authority on Google.

**Initial pillars** (confirm during onboarding):
1. Design strategy for startups (UX, conversion, growth)
2. Freelancing / agency philosophy (pricing, value, client work)
3. AI + Design (tools, workflow, industry future)
4. Technical design (Webflow, accessibility, color, typography)
5. Industry hot takes (opinions, culture, trends)

## Repurposing Chain

One piece of research becomes 5+ pieces of content:

```
Research (Perplexity)
  → Guide blog post (2000-5000 words, SEO pillar)
    → Interactive tool embed (if technical topic)
    → Condensed LinkedIn post (top insights, link in comment)
    → Twitter thread (key points, more casual)
    → Newsletter segment
    → Glossary entries (individual terms from the guide)
    → Carousel PDF (visual summary, 8-10 slides)
```

## Idea Generation

When David asks "give me content ideas," use these frameworks:

1. **Audience pain audit** — What are SaaS founders/startup CTOs struggling with in design right now? Use Perplexity to research.
2. **Competitor gap analysis** — What are other design studios/freelancers NOT talking about? What's overserved? What's missing?
3. **David's experience bank** — Past projects, client wins, mistakes, lessons learned. These become Humbl Thoughts.
4. **Trending topics** — What's happening in design/AI/SaaS this week? React to it with a unique angle.
5. **Creator Watch** — What are David's inspiration creators posting? NOT to copy — to find gaps and angles they missed.
6. **Comment mining** — What questions come up in comments on David's LinkedIn posts? Each question is a content idea.
