# Humbl Engine Skill: Ads

## LinkedIn Ads Strategy

### Best-Performing Formats for Design Studios
1. **Sponsored Content (single image)** — Portfolio showcase + "Is your SaaS making these UX mistakes?"
2. **Document Ads (carousel/PDF)** — Mini case study or checklist. Swipeable = high engagement.
3. **Thought Leader Ads** — Boost David's best organic LinkedIn posts to targeted audiences. Feels native, not salesy.

### Targeting
```
Job titles:    CEO, CTO, Co-founder, Head of Product, VP Product
Company size:  11-200 employees (startup sweet spot)
Industries:    SaaS, Fintech, AI/ML, HealthTech, EdTech
Seniority:     Director+
Exclude:       Design agencies, freelancers, students
```

### Ad Copy Formula
```
HOOK:     [Specific pain point with data]
PROOF:    [Quick result — "Helped [client] raise $12M"]
CTA:      [Low commitment — "Free audit" / "See the case study"]
```

### Budget Framework
```
Testing:     $20-50/day per ad variant. Run 3-5 variants.
Scaling:     Kill underperformers after 7 days. Scale winners.
Retargeting: $10-20/day targeting blog visitors + LinkedIn engagers.
Monthly:     Start at $500-1000. Scale based on consultation call cost.
```

### Organic → Paid Pipeline
```
Post performs well organically (50+ comments, high engagement)
  → Boost as Thought Leader Ad to wider targeted audience
  → If ad performs → create similar content for next organic cycle
  → Track: cost per profile visit, cost per website click, cost per consultation
```
