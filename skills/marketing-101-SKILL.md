# Humbl Engine Skill: Marketing 101

## Funnel Mapping

```
TOFU (Awareness)       → LinkedIn posts, Twitter, SEO blog posts, carousels
                         Goal: reach + followers + website visits

MOFU (Consideration)   → Guides with tools, case studies, lead magnets, newsletter
                         Goal: email signups + trust building

BOFU (Decision)        → Portfolio page, testimonials, free audit CTA, pricing page
                         Goal: consultation calls + project bookings
```

## Content Type → Funnel Stage
```
Glossary        → TOFU (SEO traffic, quick reference)
Guides          → TOFU/MOFU (authority, tool engagement)
Humbl Thoughts  → TOFU (personality, shareability)
Tools           → MOFU (engagement, lead magnet)
Case studies    → BOFU (proof, trust)
Lead magnets    → MOFU→BOFU bridge (email capture)
```

## CTA Placement
- **Blog posts:** Soft CTA mid-article ("Want the full checklist? Grab it free."), hard CTA at end ("Book a free audit.")
- **LinkedIn:** Link to blog in first comment. Never in post body.
- **Tools:** The tool IS the CTA — it demonstrates expertise. Add "Built by Humbl Design" footer link.
- **Every piece of content** should have ONE clear next step for the reader.

## Social Proof Patterns (from David's "Customer Proof Design" post)
- Replace vague claims with specific results: "$12M raised" not "successful funding"
- Use short video clips of real product usage
- Before/after quotes from clients
- Place proof NEXT to CTAs, not in a separate testimonials section

## Analytics That Matter
```
VANITY (ignore):  likes, impressions, follower count
USEFUL:           comments, saves, shares, profile visits, link clicks
MONEY:            email signups, consultation calls booked, project inquiries
```
