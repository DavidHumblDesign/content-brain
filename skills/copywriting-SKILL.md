# Humbl Engine Skill: Copywriting

## Core Principles

1. **Hook first.** No throat-clearing. No "In today's world." First sentence must earn the second sentence.

2. **Specificity beats generic.** "147 leads in 60 days" not "more leads." "$12M seed round" not "successful funding." "8.6:1 contrast ratio" not "good accessibility."

3. **Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS).**
   - Problem: Name the pain. ("Your hero section is losing you signups.")
   - Agitate: Twist the knife. ("Every visitor who bounces is a customer your competitor gets.")
   - Solve: Present the fix. ("Here's the 5-point framework that fixes it.")

4. **One idea per paragraph.** Short paragraphs. Punchy sentences. White space is your friend.

5. **Active voice.** "We redesigned the dashboard" not "The dashboard was redesigned by us."

6. **Cut the filler.** Delete: "basically", "essentially", "in order to", "it's important to note that", "at the end of the day", "the fact that". If a sentence works without a word, remove that word.

7. **David's voice:** Direct, confident, slightly irreverent, data-backed, never corporate. He says "This doesn't work" not "This may present some challenges." He uses "you" more than "we."

## Headlines
- Include a number when possible: "10 SaaS UX Mistakes Killing Your MRR"
- Include the benefit: "How to Fix Your Hero Section and Increase Signups"
- Create curiosity: "Is shadcn Breaking Design Standards?"
- Be specific about the audience: "For SaaS Founders Who Are Tired of Generic Design"

## CTAs
- **Soft CTA:** "If this helped, follow for more." / "Share your experience below."
- **Medium CTA:** "Link to the full guide in the first comment." / "Try the tool free — link below."
- **Hard CTA:** "Book a free design audit → link in bio." / "DM me 'audit' for a free teardown."
- Always match CTA strength to content warmth. Cold audience = soft CTA. Engaged readers = hard CTA.

## Lead Magnet Copy
```
TITLE: [Number] + [Specific outcome] + [Timeframe or constraint]
  Example: "The 5-Point Hero Section Checklist That Converts"

SUBTITLE: [Who it's for] + [What they'll get]
  Example: "For SaaS founders who want more signups without a redesign"

BULLETS: (3-5, each starts with a verb)
  ✓ Identify the #1 reason visitors bounce in under 3 seconds
  ✓ Fix your headline using the PAS framework
  ✓ [etc.]

CTA: [Action verb] + [What they get] + [Objection killer]
  Example: "Download the free checklist (no email required)"
```

## Words to Use / Avoid
**Power words:** proven, exact, specific, data, tested, framework, audit, fix, kill, crush, ship, launch, revenue, MRR, signups, conversions
**Weak words to avoid:** leverage, utilize, optimize, synergy, innovative, cutting-edge, best-in-class, robust, seamless, game-changing, delve, dive in
