# Humbl Engine Skill: LinkedIn Strategy

## Algorithm Rules (2025-2026)

1. **Topic Authority Score** — LinkedIn tracks whether you're an expert on a topic. Post about the SAME niche consistently for 60+ days and your reach multiplies. David's niche: design for startups, UX strategy, freelancing, AI + design.

2. **Comments > Likes** — Comments are 15x more valuable than likes for algorithmic reach. Write posts that provoke genuine responses, not "Agree?" bait.

3. **Golden Hour** — First 60-120 minutes after posting determine reach. Be present to reply to every comment in this window.

4. **No External Links in Post Body** — LinkedIn deprioritizes posts with links. ALWAYS put links in the first comment. Never in the post itself.

5. **Carousels & PDFs > Text > Polls > Video** — Video is deprioritized in 2025-2026. Focus on carousels (PDF documents) and well-structured text posts.

6. **Dwell Time** — Posts that keep users reading longer get boosted. Write posts worth reading, not just scanning.

7. **Niche > Generic** — "How SaaS startups can fix their hero section in 30 minutes" beats "5 design tips for your website."

8. **Failure > Success** — "How I lost $15K and what I learned" gets 6x more comments than "How I landed 10 clients."

9. **Hashtags: 3-5 max** — More than 5 looks spammy, gets deprioritized.

10. **Evergreen gets resurfaced** — LinkedIn now shows posts 2-3 weeks old if they're relevant. Quality over recency.

## Hook Formulas That Work
```
DATA HOOK:     "We spent $47K testing [X]. Here's what worked:"
FAILURE HOOK:  "I [failed at X]. Here's what I'd do differently:"
CONTRARIAN:    "Unpopular opinion: [common belief] is wrong because [reason]."
SPECIFIC:      "The exact [framework/process] we used to [specific result]."
QUESTION:      "We tried [A] and [B]. Which has worked better for you?"
BEFORE/AFTER:  "[Thing] before: [bad state]. After: [good state]. Here's what changed:"
```

## Post Structure Templates

### Story Post (for Humbl Thoughts)
```
[2-line hook — data or failure or contrarian take]

[Short context paragraph — set the scene in 2-3 sentences]

[The insight — what you learned, what changed, what you'd tell others]

[1-2 supporting points or examples]

[Close with a genuine question that invites discussion]
```

### List Post (for Guides → LinkedIn)
```
[Hook with specific number + result]

[1-line context]

Here's what works:

1. [Point] — [1-sentence explanation]
2. [Point] — [1-sentence explanation]
3. [Point] — [1-sentence explanation]
[up to 5-7 points]

[CTA: question or "Link in comments"]
```

### Hot Take Post
```
[Contrarian statement]

[Why most people get this wrong]

[What actually works — with proof or example]

[The nuance — when the common approach IS right]

[Question that invites debate]
```

## Repurposing Chain
```
Guide (blog) → Condensed LinkedIn list post (top 5 points + link in comments)
Humbl Thought (blog) → Direct LinkedIn story post (trim to 1300 chars)
Tool → LinkedIn carousel showing the tool in action + "Try it free: link in comments"
LinkedIn post that performs well → Expand into blog Guide
```

## David's Content Pillars
(To be confirmed during onboarding, but based on existing blog:)
1. **Design strategy for startups** — UX fixes that increase revenue, hero section optimization, login UX, SaaS design mistakes
2. **Freelancing/agency philosophy** — Pricing models, client relationships, finding your value, honest takes
3. **AI + Design** — How designers use AI, will AI replace designers, vibe coding, shadcn/template critique
4. **Webflow & technical design** — Project setup, CMS, accessibility, color theory
5. **Hot takes on the design industry** — Opinionated, philosophical, raw

## Engagement Rules
- Reply to EVERY comment in the first 2 hours
- Ask follow-up questions in replies (sparks threads)
- Never use "Agree?" or "Like if you..." — these get deprioritized
- Genuine questions that have multiple valid answers work best
- Tag relevant people only if you're genuinely referencing their work
- Post consistently at the same time(s) — algorithm rewards predictability
